1. TOS + SSH -> some segments may go over different ISP. Interference with firewall?
 -> SSH stalls.
 Observed TOS: 0x10
 Observed when one of site's ISPs has problems. (Haikou: 2nd ISP)

2. IPv6:
If source IPv6 address is the address of the secondary ISP, and the
secondary ISP does not work, IPv6 connection establishment times out!

Possible to give priorities in RADVD?
